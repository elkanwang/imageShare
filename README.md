## How to install

First, you have to have *node* and *npm* installed.

To check if you have node installed
```
node --version
npm --version
```

If not, please visit [install npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) and [install node](https://nodejs.org/download/)

Then, you can install the needed files and run the server
```
npm install
node server.js
```

Then you can just open the website at `http://localhost:3000`.
